          It all started with a math problem.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          What seemed like a simple challenge — writing a formula to automate a calculation — ended up unlocking a world of possibilities. 
          That first taste of coding showed me the power of turning logic into real-world solutions, and I've been hooked ever since.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the past few years, I've grown from that curious coder into a professional software engineer. At 
          <a href="https://clarivate.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="highlight-link">Clarivate Analytics</a>, 
          I spent 3 years building frontend systems, leading production deployments, and diving into CI/CD pipelines — experiences that shaped how I think about scale, reliability, and clean architecture.

          Now, as a master's student at the 
          <a href="https://www.uta.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="highlight-link">University of Texas at Arlington</a>, 
          I'm deepening my skills in system design, software architecture, and backend development with Spring Boot. My mission? To become a well-rounded full-stack developer who crafts maintainable systems that solve complex problems — elegantly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of tech, you'll find me gaming, hiking, or playing football — always seeking a new challenge, whether it's on the field or in the terminal.
