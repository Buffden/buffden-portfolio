          My journey into software engineering started with automating a simple math problem and grew into building scalable, real-world systems. At 
          <a href="https://clarivate.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="highlight-link">Clarivate Analytics</a>, I spent three years shipping production-grade features, owning CI/CD, and contributing to reliable architectures.

          <a href="https://www.uta.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="highlight-link">University of Texas at Arlington</a>, I’m deepening system design, Spring Boot, and AWS cloud skills—aiming for clean, maintainable full-stack systems. I love pairing strong design with pragmatic delivery, collaborating closely with teams to keep performance, scalability, and long-term maintainability aligned. Outside work, I recharge with video games, hiking, and football.
