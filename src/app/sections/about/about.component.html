        <p>
          Back when I first took on a challenge to solve a math problem by coding a formula, 
          I discovered the immense potential of programming to automate and optimize calculations. 
          What started as a simple challenge quickly evolved into a passion for software development and problem-solving.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at 
          <a href="https://clarivate.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="highlight-link">Clarivate Analytics</a>, 
          a leading global company where I gained invaluable experience. During my three years there, 
          I focused on frontend development while also diving into production deployments and CI/CD pipelines.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, I'm pursuing my master's degree at the 
          <a href="https://www.uta.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="highlight-link">University of Texas at Arlington</a>, 
          with a focus on system design, software architecture, and design patterns. My goal is to become a full-stack developer, 
          creating scalable, maintainable systems that solve complex problems in reusable and efficient ways.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of coding, you'll find me immersed in video games, hiking, or playing football. 
          Currently, I'm expanding my skill set by learning Spring Boot and integrating backend development 
          with my frontend expertise, while also deepening my understanding of databases.
